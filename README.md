### Project Description  
A quirky calculator that takes numbers typed in words, performs basic math operations, and streams results word-by-word with sounds. Half the time it answers correctly, the other half it serves sarcasm and memes.  

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)  
People need a calculator that‚Äôs just as confused as they are when typing numbers in words ‚Äî and with a healthy dose of sarcasm for bad inputs.  

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)  
An overly elaborate word-based calculator that gives half-accurate results, roasts your grammar, and entertains you with memes and sound effects while slowly spelling out the answer.  

## Technical Details  
### Technologies/Components Used  
**Software:**  
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Fetch API for memes  
- Audio API for sounds  

### Implementation  
**Installation**  
Just open the `index.html` in any modern browser ‚Äî no installation needed.  

**Run**  
Type your query in words and click **Answer**. Use **Stop/Clear** to halt output. Toggle background music with **Play/Pause BGM**.
